            "testimonial": "I managed Cecilia for the past three years and will sincerely miss having her on my team. Cecilia is an expert in the research landscape and somebody whom I trust to get a job done exceptionally well. When I handed her something brand new, she was resourceful and knew how to do the research and get in touch with the right people to make it happen. She's well-versed in handling complex workflows and navigating/prioritizing requests for a myriad of stakeholders. She oversaw the content audit for our Meta Research website, spearheaded a website localization effort, took on full vendor management (web dev) when I went out on parental leave, and is truly one of the most empathetic and compassionate individuals I have ever met. I have no doubt she will go on to do amazing things and will one day be leading a highly creative and compassionate team of her own."

            "testimonial": "Cecilia is a true pleasure to work with. She's professional and serious about delivering results, not only for the team she supports, but in the broader context of the company she works in. She's open to feedback and innovating on established practices, not only pushing forward her own ideas but championing initiatives authored by her colleagues as well. Cecilia is dependable, deadline driven, and highly accountable in everything she takes on. On a personal note, I find Cecilia to be one of the more kind, funny, and emotionally intelligent coworkers I've worked with. She cares deeply for others and is proactive about building strong, candid interpersonal relationships. Cecilia's skillset is flexible and she'd be a great addition to any team — I hope to work with her again in the future!"

Here are a few things Cecilia did well that I want to highlight: \nCommunication. She is very responsive and gives good feedback. \nQuality. She produces great content with high quality narratives and presentations. \nThanks for being a great partner, Cecilia!"

            "testimonial": "“Insightful and sharp” are the adjectives that come to mind when I think of Cecilia. Cecilia masterfully filled the role of Content Editor for Shmoop University during my time there. She ran multiple concurrent projects, pushing the people who reported to her to create better and better content. I was particularly impressed with Cecilia's ability to move from seemingly disparate projects with ease, making those projects her own. Cecilia, who always made everyone around the office feel welcome, would be an asset to any team."
